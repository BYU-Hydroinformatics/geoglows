The geoglows python package is intended to promote access to data, API's, and code developed as part of the `GEOGloWS
Project <http://www.geoglows.org>`_.

GEOGloWS ECMWF Streamflow Project: This project provides access to the results of a hydrologic model that is run each
day. The model is based on a group of unique weather forecasts, known as an ensemble, from ECMWF. Each unique
precipitation forecast, known as an ensemble member, produces a unique streamflow forecast. There are 52 members of the
ensemble that drives the model each day. The ERA Interim historical precipitation dataset to also used to produce a
hindcasted streamflow on each river.
